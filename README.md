What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
    I learned a lot on how critical it is to make a design first from scratch before coding. Before, I used to do HTML first without even making some thought on making a design firsthand. It's easier to have a design (drawing) before making it a reality. I have also learned how to mazimize the resources online since there are many available designs that could be used to freshen up ones website. I think I will update this portfolio in the near future if I still have time to do so.
